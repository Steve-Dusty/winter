# Pet-feeding system

## Summary

I plan on creating my first ever hardware project. I am choosing to build a pet feeding project because it can apply to me
in real life, letting me see my creation come into play. 

## Plan

I am going to buy a kit with some other accessories to help me complete the project because as a total beginner, I don't know what to buy at first
so I believe a kit would serve me the best.

1. Design my circuit and attach it to my supplies like cardboard and cans.
2. Attach that with servo and my camera, using openCV, i will detect whether if the bowl is empty. If it's empty the servo will drop food.
3. I will also code an app that lets me set timer for food dropping intervals and automatic control.

## Budget

I can pay shipping for myself
